    advice: >-
      To fix this issue, ensure that the APP_DEBUG setting is always set to false in production environments. Debug mode should never be enabled through code using functions like putenv(), the config() helper, or by modifying the $_ENV superglobal. Instead, manage debug settings securely through the .env file, setting APP_DEBUG=false. This prevents sensitive application details, such as stack traces and configuration values, from being exposed to attackers. Additionally, ensure the .env file is not publicly accessible to avoid leaking environment configurations.
