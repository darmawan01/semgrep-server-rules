      advice: >-
        To fix embedded credentials in Laravel seeders, avoid hardcoding sensitive information such as passwords, emails, or usernames directly in the seeder files. Instead, use environment variables defined in the .env file, or generate the data dynamically. For example, retrieve credentials using env('KEY') for environment-based configuration, or use a secure method for generating random passwords.
